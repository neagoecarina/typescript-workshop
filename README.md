We have an array of cars. Some of the cars are defined by brand (ex: 'Mercedes'), cost (ex: 100000), registration number (ex: 'TM-28-AAA'), size (ex:'big') and number of seats (ex: 8), while others are defined only by brand, costand number of seats. You need to display on console the array of cars after the following criterias:- if the field registration number is not provided for a car then assign 'unregistered' to it.- if the field size is not provided for a car then apply the following rule:                        * if the number of seats is greater than 5 assign 'big' to the car's size field.* if the number of seats is lower or equal than 5 assign 'small' to the car's size field.- if the field brand is one of the following: 'Mercedes', 'Audi' or 'BMW' then add 25000 to the car's cost field.
